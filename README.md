Crow shooter game by jade becknell
>Followed tutorials by  Dinesh Punni for parts of game functionality
>Followed Tutorial by inScope Studios to set up sqlite with Unity
>>All c# scripts are icluded in the scripts folder under Assets
>>Just pull the folder to unity 2018.4.3 and build and run for android
>>>It is a rather larege project and takes a while to build the first time
>>>I also included an apk file so you could just run it (final_project.apk)

I have never pushed a Unity project to github but I was able to pull and run it
so let me know of there are any major issues

Please check out the scripts, most of the work was done there, heavily commented

**Game Instructions:**
>Objective: Dont let the crow touch you
- Look at the crow and press the buttin on the headset to shoot
- Look down and back up to start walking and the same to stop
- When game over, direct pointer to restart button and click


**Notes on Functionality**
- Database functionality not fully complete
- The actual database is set up, see:
-- HighscoresManager.cs
-- Highscores.cs
-- HighScoreScript.cs in the Assets/scripts folder, just have not been able to populate the table with new scores (close to functional)
- Otherwise game features are functional
- Must look straigt down to start/stop walking (Can be a little finnicky)
- Recommend standing while playing or sitting in a swivel chair with space to turn 360 degrees
